                            <p>Welcome to Gentle Eating—a community built on the belief that managing GERD and acid reflux shouldn't mean sacrificing the joy of good food. This blog was born from personal experience and a passion for creating delicious, digestive-friendly meals.</p>
                            
                            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Journey</h2>
                            <p>Living with GERD can feel isolating. The constant worry about trigger foods, the nighttime discomfort, the anxiety around social meals—it all takes a toll. When I started experiencing chronic acid reflux, I found myself overwhelmed by conflicting information and uninspiring "safe food" lists.</p>
                            
                            <p>That's when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I spent months in the kitchen, experimenting with gentle ingredients, testing flavor combinations, and documenting what truly worked. I learned to cook without tomatoes, citrus, and heavy spices while maintaining incredible flavor. Most importantly, I discovered that gentle eating doesn't mean bland eating—it means being creative, intentional, and compassionate with yourself.</p>
                            
                            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What Makes This Blog Different</h2>
                            <p><strong>Evidence-Based Approach:</strong> Every recipe and tip is grounded in nutritional science and real-world testing. I combine research on digestive health with practical kitchen experience to create meals that truly work.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Taste Comes First:</strong> GERD-friendly doesn't have to mean flavorless. My recipes focus on maximizing flavor through gentle herbs, strategic seasoning, and smart cooking techniques that bring out natural sweetness in ingredients.</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>Realistic & Sustainable:</strong> I don't believe in extreme restrictions or complicated meal plans. These recipes use accessible ingredients and straightforward methods because the best diet is one you'll actually stick to.</p>
                            
                            <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">What I've Learned</h2>
                            <ul style="line-height: 1.8; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">
                                <li><strong>Individual triggers matter:</strong> What works for one person may not work for another—listen to your body</li>
                                <li><strong>Small, frequent meals:</strong> Better for managing reflux than large portions</li>
                                <li><strong>Home cooking is key:</strong> Control ingredients, portions, and preparation methods</li>
                                <li><strong>Mindful eating helps:</strong> Slow down, chew thoroughly, and enjoy each bite</li>
                                <li><strong>Community support matters:</strong> Sharing experiences helps everyone learn faster</li>
                            </ul>
